G\+L\+AC is a program which generates gauge configurations and has the possibility of applying gradient flow on them as well.

It takes input in the form of .json files generated by create\+Jobs.\+py, a python2 command line interfacing tool. create\+Jobs.\+py will create relevant folders for the run. In the case that we are running on an H\+PC cluster using Slurm or Torque, it will directly initiate the run by submitting the jobs unless {\ttfamily --dryrun} is specified.\hypertarget{index_Setting}{}\section{up runs.}\label{index_Setting}
